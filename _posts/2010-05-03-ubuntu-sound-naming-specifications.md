This specification gives direction on how to name the sounds that are available for use by applications, when creating a sound theme. You can also goto [Creating sounds themes for Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04](http://blogs.anayalabs.com/srijan/2010/creating-ubuntu-sound-themes-for-9-10-and-10-04/).

#### Guidelines:

Sound names are in the `en_US.US_ASCII` locale. This means that the characters allowed in the sound names must fall within the US-ASCII character set. As a further restriction, all sound names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, underscore, dash, or period characters. Spaces, colons, slashes, and backslashes are not allowed. Also, sound names must be spelled as they are in the en_US dictionary.

Standard Sound Names: The names of the sounds are self-explanatory.
