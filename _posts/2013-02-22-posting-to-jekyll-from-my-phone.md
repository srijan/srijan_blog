I recently set up my blog so that I can update it from my mobile or any browser.

I used github for hosting my code, prose.io for editing and creating posts, and a VPS to generate and push my code to the final host.

I will be updating here how exactly I did it here in a little while.

This post was made from Firefox for Android.

You can see the [code for this blog on github](https://github.com/srijan/srijan_blog).
