I recently came across a new software (during my search for awesome apps using bluetooth) for linux which lets you control a music player via your phone using bluetooth.

Right now, it supports Amarok, Audacious, Banshee, Exaile, MPD, MPlayer, Rhythmbox, Songbird, Totem, TVtime, VLC and XMMS2 among many others. It can also possibly support pdf viewers and ebook readers in the future (it already supports okular) and other apps.

It requires python2 (&gt;2.6) and the python modules: Image (a.k.a. PIL), logging, bluetooth, dbus, gobject and xdg. It may also require more modules for specific players. It also requires that we install a java app in the mobile phone to be used. It also has an android client.
