I have started a few blogs in the past, but I always lost interest after a few months, and stopped writing. Hopefully, this will not end that way.

A little background: I am a developer working for [Anayalabs](http://anayalabs.com/), a startup incubated at [BITS, Pilani, India](http://discovery.bits-pilani.ac.in/), and I have been doing some interesting work for the past 2 months on flash, flex, amfphp, java, red5 and so on. And when our company finally got a website, I started thinking of writing a blog to share what I have learnt and what I am learning here. I will soon be starting another blog, where I will talk about a few other projects I am working on.

Update: I have decided not to open a second blog, but to make this one a general blog about my adventures with technology and computers.

Update 2: I have shifted my blog (with all its posts) to my own domain now.
