I am a Software Developer currently working at <a href="http://www.greyorange.sg/">Grey Orange</a>.

My work focuses on application development, network programming, distributed systems and artificial intelligence. I use Emacs, and primarily program in Python and Erlang.

In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://github.com/srijan/">hacking with new technology</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/srijan4">listening to music</a>, and <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:srijan/">reading stuff online</a>.
