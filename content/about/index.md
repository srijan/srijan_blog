I am a founding team member and software product architect at <a href="http://www.greyorange.sg/">Grey Orange</a>.

My work focuses on full stack application development, network programming, distributed systems and artificial intelligence. I use Emacs, and primarily program in Python and Erlang.

In my free time, I enjoy [hacking with new technology](https://github.com/srijan/), [listening to music](http://www.last.fm/user/srijan4), playing guitar, and [reading stuff online](https://pinboard.in/u:srijan).
